	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an 
        algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. 
		It measures the time taken and efficient to execute each statement of code 
        in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution
        time of an algorithm.</p>
    
    <p>
        if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis 
        of space, then Auxiliary Space would be a better criterion than
        <b>Space Complexity</b>. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion
        sort, and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. The space complexity
        of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though.
